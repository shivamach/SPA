v0.1 : Dictionary

    A simple Offline Dictionary application which runs on the terminal interface.
    This app searches for a word's meaning in the existing database json available in
    the v0.1 folder.

    Initial Features introduced are:
    1. search word is caps insensitive
    2. meaning of the word is printed as a readable numbered list
    3. in-correctly spelled words can still be defined with further user interaction
    
v0.2 :
    
    Have to implement the same in django. In the previous version, the words were searched in a local incomplete 
    dictionary database. Need to replace the same with a more robust database that can work for wider choice of words
    It would be better if a word can be googled and its meaning be fetched as a result.
    Django dictionary app by itself is useless. Need to implement a user model where histroy of words searched is 
    catalogued with different pointers and hints which can be used to improve a user's vocabulary 
    Django app idea seems not plausible, maybe a browser extension will work better.
